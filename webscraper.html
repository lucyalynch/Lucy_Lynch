<h1>Team Project: Web Scraper</h1>

<a href="https://github.com/Billeneube/webscraper_2/blob/master/webscraper_2.py">Github page</a>
<p>This project was a collaberation between Jonas Blanchard, Jonah , and myself. It was an assignment for the IB Computer Science class, and was created to scrape the Amazon best-sellers page.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>
<br>
<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
Variables
<br>
Conditionals
<br>
Create/read files

<p>Twilio and BeautifulSoup were the main tools used in the development of the project. <br>
	Twilio was chosen as it is allowed the program to send notifications to the user’s phone.</p>
<p>BeautifulSoup allowed easier access to the elements of the page’s HTML code, allowing us to easily find the price and URL of the top toy on Amazon.</p>
<p>Variables are a core part of programming, and were used throughout the app to store URLs, authentication tokens, file names, and more.</p>
<p>If and else statements were also used inside the app, which provided the some of the logic of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Finally, files were created and read, which allowed it to store information between launches.</p>
